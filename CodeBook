I Information about source files to creat the required data set
After analysing which variables are required, the following files are needed for this project.

1. Subject
The observations for all subjects for both training and test come from the file: 
file_subject_train = "./UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt"
file_subject_test = "./UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt"

2. Activity 
The ativity expressioin and labels come from the file:
file_activity_labels="./UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt"

The observations of all activities for all measurements for both training and test come from:
file_activity_label_train = "./UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt"
file_activity_label_test = "./UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt"

3. Only on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
The information was extracted from V2 of the file:
file_features = "./UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt". 
Those measurment names, units are kept as same as explination in the source files 

The observations for all measurements for both training and test came from 
file_data_train = "./UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt"
file_data_test  = "./UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt"

II The variables of the data set we need to create are: subject, activity name, and a set of measurements.

III The tidy data
The first order of the didy data set is that the subject column is sorted by default ascending order from 1 to 30. 
The seconder order is that for each subject the activity column is sorted by default ascending order based on the 
activity labels from 1 to 6, not based on the letters of activity name words. Each observation data in the tidy data 
set from column 3 to 68 is the averages for each meansurement.

IV write the data set to txt file. 
To simplify, all characters are shown without quote.
